                <dd>I found the article really interesting how accurately future technologies were predicted at such a chaotic and changing time. Similar predictions of the future I have seen before focus more on physical technological advancements like space exploration or household appliances, but not informational technologies, especially half a century before the start of the information age.</dd>

                <dd>It was also interesting seeing how Bush discussed these topics from a scientist’s point of view. Even though the technologies he predicted would transform the world outside of science, he mainly wrote about how they could aid in scientific advancement.</dd>

                <dd>Although Bush’s description of the memex is very close to modern computers and the internet, I found it interesting how he designs his memex to work based on trails of linked ideas instead of search engines we use now. I imagine that if the Internet developed as Bush envisioned it would become much more decentralized as people make their own paths through sites.</dd>
